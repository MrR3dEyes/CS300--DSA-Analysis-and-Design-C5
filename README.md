Project Reflection/Journal

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  These projects focused on creating an efficient course planner system that could store, retrieve, and display course information with its prerequisites. The main challenge was selecting and implementing the most appropriate data structure to optimize search, insertion, and sorting operations for academic advising purposes. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I approached the problem by first analyzing the time and space complexity of different data structures. There were vectors, linked lists, hashtables, and a binary search tree to choose from. To determine which would best suit the requirements, I had to understand the data set and how the data would be used. Implementing the right data structure meant that one program would run faster, versus seconds to load, as data can scale. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  I would say I struggled with implementing the binary search trees' recursive functions. I used debugging tools to trace through the code step by step and drew out the tree structure to visualize the operations. I also referenced documentation and reviewed our course materials to understand proper pointer manipulation.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  This project helped teach me to analyze performance requirements before writing code and to keep efficiency in mind, rather than just start coding and then fix it later. I would say scalability and efficiency need to be considered first, and then the choice of data structures and implementation also needs to be selected now, when designing software and developing programs. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  This program has definitely helped me evolve and learn a great deal about efficiency, maintainability, and datasets. I plan on being a technical artist working on games and helping with their development. I need to focus on efficiency, resource management, and having proper reusability in mind, which allows for my future programs and systems to be optimized. Having the proper classes and functions is necessary, but in a sense, having code that can be edited without affecting other major parts of the software matters.Through this project, I learned how important modular design and separation of concerns are when building maintainable programs. By structuring my code so that each component handles a specific task, I can make changes or add new features without introducing errors elsewhere. This mindset has helped me think more like a software designer, not just a programmer.
